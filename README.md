### 🕵️ Biography

<hr/>

👋 I am Agogibus and I discovered the computer world.

💻 I did 3 years of study at School 42, learning code from scratch (C, C++, Docker, k8s, bash, JavaScrip, NestJs, React, git...)

👀 Now I decided to expand my skillset with new language and to try cybersecurity.

📁My favorite project at 42 :

    🌐 webserve : We reimplementated a HTTP/1.1 web server following RFC, based on nginx model.
    
    🎮 ft_transcendence : Full-stack application which allows user play pong game online and chat among each other.
